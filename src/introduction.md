# Introduction
Welcome, everyone, to the official guide of **JaeyeongScript**! We sincerely greet you with open arms!
So, **what is JaeyeongScript?** JaeyeongScript is a simple script being developed with the aim of entertaining and teasing Lee Jaeyeong, the developer of this language, similar to Team Fishydino's other project called **"woojin"**. Furthermore, unlike woojin, Jaeyeong himself is **actively participating in the development process of JaeyeongScript**.

## Our Goal
JaeyeongScript is not just about teasing Lee Jaeyeong; it has other purposes as well. The following are the goals that JaeyeongScript aims to achieve:
* **Add data analysis capabilities:** JaeyeongScript intends to incorporate data analysis features to make it usable within **Emotion**, The School Club(They specialize in learning artificial intelligence, and Jaeyeong is also a member of that club). This is the ultimate goal that JaeyeongScript aims to accomplish. We are aware that achieving this goal is challenging, but we will put in our utmost effort.
* **Performance and stability:** JaeyeongScript consistently strives to improve its performance and stability. Although our programming skills may not be perfect, we are committed to making JaeyeongScript stable and fast in its operation. We will continue to make efforts in this regard.
* **Challenging yet fun syntax:** Please remember that JaeyeongScript was originally created to tease Jaeyeong! Most of the syntax in JaeyeongScript is designed to poke fun at Jaeyeong. The grammar of JaeyeongScript may appear complex and difficult to grasp for developers accustomed to traditional programming languages. However, don't worry! This guide is here for you, to help you navigate through the complexities and difficulties.

Since JaeyeongScript is a project **initiated to tease Jaeyeong**, our goal is to have more people using it. We hope that more people will join us in teasing Jaeyeong! (Of course, he may not desire it, **but that's not our concern!**)

> **Note(PLEASE READ THIS):** JaeyeongScript is **currently under development**. All the features mentioned in this document are still being developed and may not work properly even in the latest version of JaeyeongScript. In fact, **JaeyeongScript itself is not yet functioning correctly.** It is an unreleased programming language that is still in the development stage.
