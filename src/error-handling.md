# Error Handling
When writing programs in programming languages such as JavaScript, Rust, or others, you will often encounter unexpected errors. These errors can occur due to various reasons, ranging from minor mistakes by the developer (such as variable names or missing semicolons) to more significant errors like deadlocks. JaeyeongScript is no exception to this.

JaeyeongScript strives to detect as many issues as possible to help users write safer code. It also puts a lot of effort into providing error messages that users can easily understand and clearly identify the problems encountered. Even when reading error messages, JaeyeongScript aims to create messages that are not only informative and concise but also engaging and enjoyable. The team is constantly working hard to achieve this goal.

Before executing the code, JaeyeongScript interprets the syntax and makes significant efforts to detect and report as many errors as possible to the users. By detecting as many errors as possible at compile time, it aims to minimize the number of runtime errors. This approach enhances the stability and reliability of JaeyeongScript. However, it's important to note that there are limits to the errors that can be detected at compile time. For instance, errors like infinite waiting states are challenging to detect at compile time (even if they could be detected, it is practically impossible to implement due to the limitations of the JaeyeongScript development team's capabilities).
